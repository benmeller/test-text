# test-text
Algorithm prototype for The Ron Project's water diagnostics kit and associated text messaging system. This algorithm collects and processes new texts.  

This algorithm will create a new csv file based on month. These csv files will be placed in the **output** folder. You can see the *May.csv* as an example.
